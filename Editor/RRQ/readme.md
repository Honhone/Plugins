This tool consists of three parts.  
It's intended use is to save time manually debugging render queue in unity, particularly aimed at card-based hair assets.  
SRQPersist - Stores and Restores values on "Set Render Queue" MonoBehaviours. This is useful to get the change done persistent.  
RuntimeRenderQueue - MonoBehaviour that updates render rueues on renderers during runtime.  
ReflectionHelper - static reflection methods.
